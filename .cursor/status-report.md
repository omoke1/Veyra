- ✅ `Market.sol` - Binary prediction market with:
  - Trading (buy/sell shares)
  - Oracle resolution
  - Redemption
  - Fee handling
- ✅ `Vault.sol` - Collateral escrow per market
- ✅ `PayoutCalculator.sol` - Pure library for payouts
- ✅ `Roles.sol` - Access control roles
- ✅ `Errors.sol` - Custom error library

#### **Security Features**
- ✅ ReentrancyGuard on Market
- ✅ Pausable functionality
- ✅ Role-based access control
- ✅ Input validation
- ✅ CEI pattern (partial - needs verification)

**Status:** Contracts are written but need:
- ⚠️ Foundry tests execution/verification
- ⚠️ Deployment scripts tested
- ⚠️ Security audit

---

### 3. **Indexer (EXISTS - NEEDS WIRING)**

- ✅ Express server setup
- ✅ Ethers.js integration
- ✅ SQLite database
- ✅ Event listener structure
- ⚠️ Needs to be wired to dashboard (replace mocks)

---

## 🚧 Partially Complete / In Progress

### **Phase B Deliverables (from scratchpad.md)**
- ⚠️ Node Health module (Operators tab exists but may need enhancement)
- ⚠️ Signature verification for attestations (UI exists, needs actual crypto verification)
- ⚠️ Querystring-preserved filters (not implemented)
- ⚠️ Quick dev actions (buttons exist but not functional)

---

## ❌ Not Started / Planned

### **Phase C Deliverables**
- ❌ Wire to real APIs/contracts (currently using mocks)
- ❌ Pagination/virtualization for large lists
- ❌ Authentication for internal operations
- ❌ Real-time data updates (polling/WebSocket)

### **Backend Integration**
- ❌ API layer to connect dashboard to indexer
- ❌ Contract event listeners for live updates
- ❌ IPFS gateway integration for proof fetching
- ❌ Actual signature verification implementation

### **Smart Contract Phase 1 Completion**
- ❌ Foundry tests execution
- ❌ Deployment to Sepolia testnet
- ❌ Chainlink Functions integration verification
- ❌ End-to-end market creation → trading → resolution flow

### **Smart Contract Phase 2 (Base Sepolia + Custom Relayer)**
- ❌ `VPOOracleRelayer.sol` implementation
- ❌ Attestation schema definition
- ❌ Off-chain relayer service
- ❌ EIP-712/ECDSA signature verification
- ❌ Replay protection and expiry handling

### **External Integrations (Phase 3)**
- ❌ UMA Optimistic Oracle adapter (`IVPOAdapter.sol` implementation)
- ❌ Gnosis Conditional Tokens integration
- ❌ Polymarket adapter

## 📊 Architecture Status

### ✅ **Completed Architecture Components**
- View layer (shadcn/Tailwind components)
- ViewModel layer (UI logic separation)
- Manager layer (business logic)
- Type definitions
- Wallet integration
- Mock data providers

### ⚠️ **Missing Architecture Components**
- Coordinator pattern (navigation/state flow)
- API integration layer
- Real-time update mechanism
- Authentication system
- Error boundary/recovery

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria Check

From `scratchpad.md`:
- ✅ Build compiles with no lints
- ✅ Pages load under 2s locally
- ⚠️ KPI numbers refresh live (UI ready, needs real data)
- ⚠️ Lists support paging, sorting, and search (partially - search exists, pagination missing)
- ⚠️ Attestation view can open JSON and verify signatures (UI exists, verification needs implementation)

---

## 🔍 Files to Review for Next Steps

1. **Contract Tests:** `protocol/test/` - Verify test coverage
2. **Deployment Scripts:** `protocol/scripts/deploy.ts` - Test deployment
3. **Indexer:** `indexer/src/` - Verify event listeners and API setup
4. **API Routes:** Need to create `web/src/app/api/` for data endpoints

---

## 📝 Notes

- Dashboard UI is production-ready for Phase A MVP
- All mock data structures match planned data contracts
- Architecture follows OOP principles with proper separation
- Wallet integration is complete and functional
- Next priority: Connect to real contracts and data
